Prana is a word/meaning anotation application that allows you to store words
and their meaning so that you can list all of them or just displaying a
random word/meaning anywhere.

With this application you can easily memorize words in other languages by
the old method of repetition, but instead of using a fridge you use your
computer :)
You can embed this application to any webpage you own, desktop widget or
even Gmail.

There is support as well for verbs, so you are not limited to a single word
anotation.
